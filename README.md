# FROST

Code for the paper: "FROST: Faster and more Robust One-shot Semi-supervised Training" by Helena E. Liu and Leslie N. Smith.

![FROST comparisons](TF-FROST/images/teaser.png?raw=true "FROST comparisions")

This repository contains two sets of codes: one for the PyTorch version that is contained in the folder PT-FROST and the other for the TensorFlow version that is contained in TF-FROST. Both folders contain README files that describe how to install dependencies, setup the datasets, and run the codes to replicate our experiments.
